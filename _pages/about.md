Hi! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University. I work with [Lucas Janson](https://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/index.html) and [Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/), primarily in the areas of selective inference, high-dimensional inference and causal inference. Prior to joining Harvard, I obtained a B.Stat. and an M.Stat. from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.
