Hi! I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the Department of Statistics at Harvard University where I work with [Lucas Janson](https://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/index.html) and [Kosuke Imai](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/) primarily in the areas of Selective Inference, High-dimensional Inference and Causal inference. Prior to joining Harvard, I obtained a B.Stat and M.Stat from the Indian Statistcal Institute, Kolkata, India.
